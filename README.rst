Make neuroscientist analyze MR data freely

The aim of MRfree is to develop a neuroscience-orientated Python toolbox for magnetic resonance(MR) imaging data analysis.

In MRfree we aim to:

1. Integrate multi-modality MRI analysis.

2. Integrate region and tract analysis.

3. Integrate surface and volume analysis.

4. Integrate structural and functional analysis.

5. Integrate voxel(vertex) and ROI analysis.

6. Integrate computation and visualization.
